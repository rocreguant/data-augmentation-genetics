## General overview

### Project title:  

Data augmentation techniques for non-image data (genetics) 
 
### Project description: 

There have been many efforts to perform data augmentation, especially in images, to improve deep learning models’ performances. Data augmentation plays an important role to increase data availability and balancing class distribution. In addition, it enhances the model’s performances by improving generalization, mitigation of overfitting, and increasing model robustness. In this project, the student will implement data augmentation techniques to genetic data and assess if the above-mentioned benefits can be successfully transferred to this novel domain. Depending on student’s progress, this can be converted into a scientific publication. 

### Ideal outcome 

The students will create a python tool that loads genetic data (VCF files) performs the “augmentation” and saves it. It is also important to get some evaluating metrics such as model performance or feature importances. 

### Technical skills 

Basic python, ML, and data science skills.
